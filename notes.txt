Recipe Management Application (SPA) Outline
Frontend (React)

    Single Page Application:
        Routes for browsing recipes, viewing details, and adding new recipes.
        Implemented React Router for client-side routing.
        Used Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

    Features Implemented:
        Recipe Listing: Browse all recipes.
        Recipe Detail Page: View specific recipe details.
        Add Recipe Form: Form to add a new recipe (title, ingredients, cooking instructions, and optional cover image).
        Search Functionality: Search recipes by title or ingredient.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

    Node.js and Express Setup:
        Set up a basic Express server to handle API routes.
        Configured to run using PM2 (with automatic restart on reboot).
        Connected to MongoDB for persistent storage.

    API Endpoints:
        GET /recipes: Retrieve all recipes.
        GET /recipes/:id: Retrieve a specific recipe by ID.
        POST /recipes: Add a new recipe to the database.
        PUT /recipes/:id: Update an existing recipe.
        DELETE /recipes/:id: Delete a specific recipe.

    MongoDB Integration:
        MongoDB running in a Docker container.
        Successfully connected to MongoDB and the API can interact with it.
        Docker restart policy set to ensure MongoDB container starts on system reboot.
        Data validation and error handling added for API routes.

Deployment and Automation:

    PM2 for API:
        The API is being managed by PM2 for process management and auto-restart on failure or reboot.

    MongoDB in Docker:
        MongoDB is running inside a Docker container.
        Docker is configured to restart MongoDB automatically on system reboots.

    NGINX as Reverse Proxy:
        NGINX is set up as a reverse proxy to handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to the Express API running on port 5000.
        NGINX is configured to serve the React frontend and API on the same domain, with proper routing.
        SSL configuration with OpenSSL: Used OpenSSL to generate SSL certificates for secure HTTPS traffic.
        The frontend React app is served statically by NGINX, while API requests are forwarded to the backend Express server.

    Backup & Restore:
        Still need to configure a backup strategy for MongoDB (e.g., using mongodump for MongoDB backups).
        Consider automated backups and maybe setting up PM2 for backup management.

Next Steps / Features to Implement:

    Backup Strategy: Set up MongoDB backups (manual or automated).
    Frontend Enhancements: Improve UI/UX, add features like image uploads for recipes.
    Search Functionality: Enhance search with MongoDBâ€™s full-text search or use external services.
    State Management: Implement Context API or Redux to manage the app state efficiently.
    Deploy: Set up deployment on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.
    Documentation: Finalize setup instructions and README with clear deployment and usage guidelines.
